##Module Pattern

This pattern allows large files to be split up into smaller codes and helps to make them reusuable. This pattern also allows data encapsulation which allows the contents to be accessable within the module but not from ourside. Only the contents with the `export` keyword can be accessed from other modules.

This pattern also allows user to `import` only what is needed instead of loading up the entire contents from the module.
